category-description: "The category cloud-computing contains identified Dark Tactics for the user scenario in which the remote cloud is complemented by the use of resources at the edge of the network, i.e., edge computing. In this paradigm, existing cloud users and new edge users choose to use resources closer to the end user to host their digital assets. Reasons for doing so may be the need to decrease end-to-end latency, perform data pre-processing, and address privacy concerns or difficulties in connecting to the remote cloud."
