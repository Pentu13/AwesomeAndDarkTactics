t-description: 'The public cloud provides access to a wide variety of resources without the need for prior investments. Hence, it is relatively easy to compare different cloud services as opposed to purchasing, installing, and operating similar components on- premise. The measured performance of the different resources for a specific workload can be compared to allow data-driven decisions for the fitting architecture. Once information about the energy consumption is available in the public cloud, developers could perform experiments to discover the most energy-efficient architecture. Furthermore, targets can be defined to optimize energy efficiency. We expect that these experiments can result in increased energy efficiency. However, it requires business requirements to optimize the energy efficiency and instruments to monitor the energy consumption in the public cloud.'
