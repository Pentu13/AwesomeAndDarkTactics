t-description: "Using services from AWS instead of implementing all functionalities from scratch is often more cost-efficient. The cloud-native software services are developed by specialists and native to the infrastructure. It is difficult to assess whether reusing AWS services has a positive effect on the energy efficiency of the workload. This is partly due to the lack of transparency of AWS native services concerning their energy consumption. Moreover, AWS services are versatile and potential effects on energy efficiency should be assessed per case. A potential positive effect on energy efficiency is the fact that the service might be more specialized and native to the architecture which causes less overhead. On the other hand, a service-driven design also introduces overhead due to communication mechanisms and orchestrators. Furthermore, it should be noted that there are also commercial incentives for offering AWS services at competitive prices."
