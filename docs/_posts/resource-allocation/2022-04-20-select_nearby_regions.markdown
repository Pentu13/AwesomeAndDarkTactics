t-description: "Regions with high renewable energy rates can be selected to reduce the energy footprint of cloud instances. Many cloud providers are transparent regarding the energy sources and allow users to select regions based on the amount of generated renewable energy. For example, GCP introduces a dashboard to chose a cloud region according to the lowest CO2 footprint. Note that regions with higher renewable energy rates could be more costly."
