t-description: "Reserved instances are long-term commitments for resource usage at a discounted price. The relation between reserved instances and energy efficiency is not straightforward as the same amount of energy will be consumed by the software regardless of whether the instances are reserved or not. Reserving instances does increase the predictability of the energy that will be consumed. Hence, the cloud provider can provision the required resources and does not need many idle resources that are ready for changing demand. A downside of reserved instances with respect to the energy consumption is that cloud consumers experience fewer incentives to turn off the resources as they are paid for (with discounts) in advance and turning them off will not provide financial benefits. It would be up to the cloud provider to come up with different incentives for cloud consumers to take the energy efficiency of the reserved instances into consideration."
