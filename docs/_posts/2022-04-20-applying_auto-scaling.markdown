t-description: "Auto scaling involves scaling the application to optimize the performance and costs. The application is monitored and automatically adjusted to ensure stable performance at the lowest costs. This enables on-demand resource usage which is a different approach compared to the traditional method where extra resources are constantly available to be prepared for peak load. When applying auto-scaling, the number of resources used are adjusted based on the workload. Hence, the energy to power the resources is proportional to the workload. Thus, we expect a positive effect of auto-scaling on energy efficiency."
