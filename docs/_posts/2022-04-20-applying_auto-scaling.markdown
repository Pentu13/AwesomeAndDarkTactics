t-description: "Auto-scaling involves scaling the application to optimize the performance and costs. The application is monitored and automatically adjusted to ensure stable performance at the lowest costs. This enables on-demand resource usage which is a different approach compared to the traditional method where extra resources are constantly available to be prepared for peak load."
t-participant: "Cloud consumer"
t-artifact: "Resources such as servers, VMs, or Kubernetes nodes/containers"
t-targetQA: "Performance"
t-relatedQA: "Energy-efficiency, availability"
t-goal: "When developing software in the cloud, not all developers are adapted to this new approach and still use more resources than necessary to be ready for peak load rather than automatically scaling up, and hence taking full advantage of the benefits of cloud."
