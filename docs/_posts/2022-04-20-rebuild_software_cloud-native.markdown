t-description: "Instead of migrating existing software, rebuilding the software cloud-native could save costs as the system becomes more efficient and optimally uses the underlying infrastructure. This tactic does not apply when the software is not owned by the consumer. It is difficult to generalize the effect of cloud-native software on energy consumption and, hence, should be assessed per case. "
