t-description: ' Description. Granular scaling involves breaking down the workload into smaller components. Accordingly, the used resources can be scaled down into smaller chunks. This results in a better match between the physical resources and the workload. The workload needs to be re-architected to be able to scale up and down in smaller granularities. Granular scaling allows a precise match of the physical hardware to the workload. To illustrate, if a workload consists of two components with the same specification and the resource utilization is 75%, both components are required to run the workload. In contrast, when the workload consists of four components, one component can be switched off to facilitate the 75% resource utilization. Switching off resources results in cost and energy savings.'
