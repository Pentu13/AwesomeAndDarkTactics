  Search and query strategies can be optimized to increase efficiency and,
  therefore, reduce costs. AWS Athena is a query service to analyze data in
  Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena charges for the amount of data being
  scanned to retrieve the query data. Hence, to optimize the costs of a query,
  the developer needs to ensure that a minimum amount of data is scanned. For
  example, whenever a key is frequently positioned at a certain location, first,
  this location should be scanned to prevent redundant scans. Processing less
  data results in less computing power and memory usage. Thus, a reduction in
  energy usage is expected.
