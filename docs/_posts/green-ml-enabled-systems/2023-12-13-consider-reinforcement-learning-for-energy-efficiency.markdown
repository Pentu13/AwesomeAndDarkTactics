  Algorithms can be designed to optimize energy efficiency through reinforcement
  learning. Reinforcement learning receives feedback on its actions and adjusts
  its behavior accordingly. Reinforcement learning models can be used to
  identify the most energy-efficient options in real-time and make informed
  decisions based on this information. Additionally, other quality attributes
  can also be targeted for optimization.
