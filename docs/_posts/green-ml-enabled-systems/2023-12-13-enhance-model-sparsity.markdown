t-description: >-
  Enhancing sparsity of a machine learning model means reducing the number of
  model parameters or setting their values to zero. For example, weight
  sparsification involves identifying and removing unnecessary or less important
  weights in a neural network. Enhancing model sparsity decreases the complexity
  of the model and consequently reduces requirements for storage and memory.
  Therefore, it also results in lower power consumption.
