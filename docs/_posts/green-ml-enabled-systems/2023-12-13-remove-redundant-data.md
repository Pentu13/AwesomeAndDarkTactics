t-description: "Identifying and removing redundant data for ML models reduces computing time, number of computations, energy consumption, and memory space. Redundant data refers to data points that do not contribute significantly to improving the accuracy of the model. Thus, removing these unimportant datapoints does not sacrifice much accuracy (Dhabe et al. 2021)"
