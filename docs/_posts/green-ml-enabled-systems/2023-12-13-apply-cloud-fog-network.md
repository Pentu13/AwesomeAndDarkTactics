t-description: "Devices at the edge are usually connected to distant cloud services. However, bringing the cloud closer to edge devices could be more energy efficient. A cloud fog network (CFN) is one way to achieve that. CFN supports an architecture where deep neural network models are processed in servers between end-devices and clouds. For example, Yosuf et al. (2021) present a CFN architecture that consists of four layers: IoT end devices, Access Fog (AF), Metro Fog (MF), and Cloud Datacenter (CDC). This architecture led to a 68% reduction in power consumption when compared to a traditional cloud data center architecture on average."
