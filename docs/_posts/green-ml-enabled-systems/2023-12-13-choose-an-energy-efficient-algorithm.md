t-description: "Different machine learning algorithms have different levels of energy consumption and computational power. For example, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm has a much higher energy consumption than Random Forest (RF) (Kaack et al., 2022). High energy consumption does not necessarily mean that those algorithms perform better or achieve higher accuracy levels than low-energy algorithms. "
