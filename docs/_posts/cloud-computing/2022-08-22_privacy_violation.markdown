t-description: "The characteristics of cloud computing (e.g., remote data storage, platform sharing, service dynamic change, just to mention a few) make privacy protection particularly challenging. Privacy violation, however, regularly occurs purposely, when cloud providers e.g., do not comply with enterprise policies or legislation, or force/persuade users to give personal information against their will."
