  One of the direct rebound effects of cloud migration, together with the dark
  tactics overconsumption and superfluous usages. By providing cheaper, less
  energy-intensive and easier-to-use technologies, the cloud computing paradigm
  tends to foster growth in data traffic and consumption and to enable the
  emergence of superfluous usages that were not possible before (e.g., using a
  navigation system on the phone although your car has one already built-in).
  This negates (at least partially) the promised energy savings. Cisco reveals
  evidences of such a traffic growth. The average traffic per capita per month
  was expected to grow from 12.9GB in 2016 to 35.5GB in 2021, while the number
  of Internet users would grow from 44% of the global population to 58% in the
  same period. This growth may not be caused solely by the shift to cloud
  computing but it remains an indicator of a potential rebound effect.
  Unfortunately, rebound and transformational effects are insufficiently
  discussed in the field and their multifaceted nature makes them hard to
  measure. Nonetheless, there exist definitions of rebound effects in cloud
  computing and frameworks to categorize them, paving the way to more precise
  assessment.oewndoinedwendoiewndwednweoidnoendwndowendioewdonewiodn

  Counteracting the rebound effect of a technology means to question ourselves
  on the basic need that this technology is fulfilling. Lange & Santarius
  introduce digital sufficiency as a principle for sustainable digitalization,
  which they define as 'as much digitalization as necessary and as little as
  possible'. The idea is to shift towards designing longer-lasting and reparable
  hardware and software, only collecting necessary data and placing the user
  back at the center of the concerns.
