t-description: "Real-time information about energy consumption can help to save energy. When migrating to the cloud, the user adds an additional intermediary between her and her impacts, thus becoming less aware of them. Because of the Jevons paradox2, the problem of reducing the high energy consumption cannot be solved solely by increasing efficiency. If the energy consumption is hidden from the end user by the cloud provider, this creates unsustainability."
t-participant: "end-user, cloud-user"
t-artifact: "Subscribed services"
t-context: "Normal operation"
t-feature: "Absence of environmental indicator"
t-intent: "Making the negative environmental impact generated by the cloud user less visible to the cloud user"
t-intentmeasure: "Environmental cost of service use, monetary counterpart"
t-countermeasure: "Better information to the user. For example, there exist investigations of different approaches and instruments to trigger behavior change at the cloud user and end user side."
