This has an impact on resource utilization that has to be investigated both for producing them but also for running them, i.e. to perform lifecycle assessments. As part of this effort, Pirson & Bol provide a carbon footprint assessment of IoT edge devices (focusing on the production and transport phases) that shows the consequent impact these devices have.",
