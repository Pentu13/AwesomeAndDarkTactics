  "t-description": "Moving computing resources closer to users decreases the latency. Furthermore, the system can be designed in a way that only processed/aggregated data need to be transported which reduces the amount of data traffic. Transporting less data over the network is expected to reduce the energy consumption.",

The energy consumption of the data transport, on the other hand, differs several orders of magnitude when comparing the on edge versus cloud-only scenarios. The reduction in data transport is also a main motivation for applying the edge architecture. Therefore, we argue that, in a scenario where large volumes of data need to be processed, applying an edge architecture has a positive effect on the energy consumption of the workload. In this specific case study a difference of 21.242 kWh was identified between the cloud-only and edge scenario, indicating a decrease of the energy consumption of 96% when using the edge scenario.",
