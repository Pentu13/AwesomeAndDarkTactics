  "t-description": "Apply built-in library functions in the machine learning model instead of writing custom implementations. The existing built-in library functions are usually optimized and well-tested, which is why they may have improved performance and energy efficiency compared to custom-made functions. These built-in libraries can be used for instance for tensor operations.",
