  "t-description": "Complex AI models have shown to have high energy consumption and therefore scaling down model complexity can contribute to environmental sustainability. Simplifying the model structure can lead to faster training and inference times, making it more efficient to deploy and use in real-world applications. For example, using simple three-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures (Morotti et al, 2021) and shallower Decision Trees (Abreu et al, 2020) has shown to be energy-efficient while still providing high levels of precision.",
