  "t-description": "Some algorithms may have lightweight alternatives. Using these lighter models can have a lower energy consumption without sacrificing other important quality attributes. For example, Sorbaro et al (2020) noted that a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is seen as a lightweight alternative for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN models can be converted to SNNs without a significant loss of accuracy or performance.",
